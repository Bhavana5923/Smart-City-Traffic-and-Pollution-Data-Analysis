# Smart City Traffic and Pollution Data Analysis 🚦🌫️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes urban traffic patterns and air pollution levels to support smart city planning and data-driven decision-making. By combining traffic congestion data with pollution metrics, the project identifies critical hotspots, peak congestion hours, and their impact on air quality.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Rapid urbanization has led to increased vehicle congestion and rising air pollution levels, negatively affecting public health and daily life. City authorities often lack integrated insights that correlate traffic density with pollution levels, making it difficult to implement effective traffic management and pollution control strategies.
## 🛠️ Solution Approach
- Collected traffic data including vehicle count, average speed, location, date, and hour
- Collected pollution data including PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, and NO₂ levels
- Cleaned and transformed datasets using Python and Excel
- Stored and queried structured data using MySQL
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations
- Built interactive dashboards in Tableau for visualization and insights

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- MySQL
- Microsoft Excel
- Tableau

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified traffic congestion hotspots with high pollution levels
- Found strong correlation between peak traffic hours and increased PM2.5 and NO₂ level
- Highlighted locations requiring traffic optimization and pollution control measures
